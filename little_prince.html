	As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him 
</br>
<br>
in my arms and set out walking once more.I felt deeply
</br>
<br>
<span class="ul">
 moved, and stirred. It seem to me that I was

</br>
<br>
carrying a very  fragile treasure.
</span>
<span class="bhtext">
It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.
</span>
In the
<br>
moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed 
</br>
<br>
eyes,his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I
</br>
<br>
 said to myself:
<span class="rtext">
"What I see here is nothing but a shell.What is most important is invisible..."
</br>
<br>
As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a
</br>
<br>
half-smile,I said myself,again:
<span class="rtext">
"What moves me
</br>
<br>
so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose
</br>
<br>
that shines through his whole being like the flame
</br>
<br>
of a lamp, even when he is sleep..."
</span>
And I felt
</br>
<br>
him to be more fragile still. 
<span class ="ul">
I felt the need of
</br>
<br>
protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that
</br>
might be extingusihed by a little puff of wind...
</br>
