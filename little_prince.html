	As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
<span class="s1">

	I felt deeply moved,</br> and stirred. It seem to me that I was carrying a very  fragile treasure.
</span>
<span class="s2">

	It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.
</span>
	In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes,his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
<span class="s3">
	"What I see here is nothing but a shell.What is most important is invisible..."
</span>

	As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile,I said myself,again:
<span style="s3">

"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is sleep..."
</span>
	And I felt him to be more fragile still.
<span class="s1"> 
	I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extingusihed by a little puff of wind...
</span>
