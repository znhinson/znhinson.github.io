    <span style="s1">I felt deeply moved, and stirred.
    It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>
    <span style="s2"><b>It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</b></span>
    In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead,
    his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:<b> <span style="s3">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù</span></b>
    <br>As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:<b> <span style="s3">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</span></b>And I felt him to be more fragile still.<span style="s1">I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span>
