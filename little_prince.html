	As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
<span class="ul">
I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seem to me that I was carrying a very  fragile treasure.
</span>
<span class="bhtext">
It seemed to me, even,that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.
</span>
In the moonlight I looked at his pale foregead, his closed eyes,hislocks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
<span class="rtext">
"What I see here is nothing but a shell.What is important is invisible..."
</span>
As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of half-smile,I said to myself, again:
<span class="rtext">
"What moves me so deeply,about this little prince who is sleeping here,is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."
</span>
And I felt him to be more fragile still.
<span class="rhtext">
I felt the need of protecting him,as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...
</span>
